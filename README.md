this is it, I started learning python, Its been almost 4 months, in and out, procrastinate(something I have to work on fixing) and countless hours of coding, mostly python, but also
learning other computer related stuff on the way, like git, etc...
for the most part Im reading that automate the boring stuff with python textbook, https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter17/
the inability to afford online learning sources and ebooks has led to me fitgirl-ing the paid stuff, being in a 3rd world country just leaves me with no choice, especially when
you consider my family has their own financial problems, I know Its bad to fitirl stuff but what other choice do I have? am I just gonna read python documentation? no thanks
If you arrive to this point, thank you for reading, and I hope you get something of value out of this repository
